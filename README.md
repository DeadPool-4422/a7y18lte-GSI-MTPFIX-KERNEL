### Using `parted` utility
`parted` is a utility for manipulating disk partitions. It supports multiple partition table formats, including MBR and GPT.

You can download `parted` and other partition tools from the repo itself. Look for the file named `parted_gdisk_fdisk_mkfs-ext4-aarch64.zip` and extract `parted` from it.

**Steps:**

1. Extract the `parted` binary:

```bash
7z x parted_gdisk_fdisk_mkfs.ext4-AARCH64.zip
cd parted_gdisk_fdisk_mkfs.ext4-AARCH64
```

2. Transfer `parted` to your device using ADB:

```bash
adb push parted /parted
```

Once `parted` is transferred to your device, it can be executed from the recovery terminal. To do so, type `parted` followed by the partition block that you wish to interact with. For example:

```bash
parted /dev/block/mmcblk0
```

Upon initiating `parted`, the `(parted)` prompt will appear. Here, you can manage your device's partitions. To view the partition table, enter 'print' at the `(parted)` prompt. This will display the partition layout of the specified block device.

**Example Output:**

```bash
GNU Parted 1.8.8.1.179-aef3

Using /dev/block/mmcblk0

Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.

(parted) quit
```

To exit the `parted` interface, simply type 'quit' at the `(parted)` prompt.

After exiting the `parted` interface, you may want to utilize built-in commands for formatting partitions into different file formats. This is particularly useful if you're experiencing specific errors during recovery, such as the "Cannot mount /preload" error.

## Resolving "Cannot mount /preload" Error in Recovery

This section offers steps to resolve the "Cannot mount /preload" error often encountered during recovery. 

üö® **Important: The following steps involve partition formatting, which can cause data loss. It's crucial to back up your data before performing these operations. Proceed with extreme caution.** üö®

**Formatting Partitions:**

1. Unmount the problematic partition using the `umount` command:

    ```bash
    umount /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/preload
    ```

2. Format the partition to the `ext4` file system using the `mke2fs` command:

    ```bash
    mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/preload
    ```

Should you encounter a similar error with a different partition, you can use the same process. However, replace `/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/preload` with the path corresponding to the partition causing the error.

**Note:** Again, these operations can lead to data loss. Please ensure all valuable data is backed up before proceeding. The `/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/preload` path used in this example is specific to the "Cannot mount /preload" error. If you're experiencing issues with a different partition, replace this path with the relevant partition path for your device.
