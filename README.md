# Stock rom
i have also included the Android 10 samsung OneUI 2.0 of the device in the repo with the name **Stockrom-Degoogled.zip** 
just download the file and flash it in recovery and don't forget to flash the dm-verity afterwards in case device goes in download mode

as the name suggests the rom has no gapps included 
you can flash any of your preferred GAPPS 
but i'd recommend downloading from 
https://opengapps.org/

Recommended - ARM64 --> 10.0 --> Pico
